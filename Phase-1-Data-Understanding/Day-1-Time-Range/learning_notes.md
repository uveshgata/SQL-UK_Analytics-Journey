## What I Learned

Before performing any analysis, it is important to understand the time coverage of the dataset.

Using MIN() and MAX() helped identify:

- The earliest transaction date
- The latest transaction date

This confirmed that the dataset covers the full year of 2024.

## Analyst Thinking

If the time range was incomplete, any trend or comparison analysis could be misleading.

Understanding time coverage ensures:
- Reliable trend analysis
- Accurate business insights
