## What I Learned

Before analysing trends, it is important to understand the value range in the dataset.

Using MIN() and MAX() helped identify:

- The lowest transaction price
- The highest transaction price

This showed that some transactions have extremely low values.

## Analyst Thinking

Very low values may represent:
- Non-market transactions
- Adjustments
- Special transfers

If not understood, these can distort:

- Average price
- Market trend analysis

Recognising value range helps in deciding whether filtering is needed in later analysis.
